## 💡 Key Insights from Documentation Process

### What Worked Well
1. **Structured approach:** Breaking tasks into Strategy → Users → Academic
2. **Comprehensive citations:** 39 papers provide solid foundation
3. **Real-world focus:** Use cases grounded in actual PM pain points
4. **Modular design:** Each component (ML, LLM, MCDA) independent and testable

### Challenges Identified
1. **Data acquisition:** May need to rely heavily on synthetic data initially
2. **LLM costs:** Need to budget carefully, optimize prompts
3. **Generalizability:** Models trained on limited data may not transfer well
4. **User adoption:** Need strong explainability to build trust

### Design Decisions Justified
1. **File upload vs. API integration:** Reduces complexity, maintains extensibility
2. **TOPSIS for MCDA:** Simpler than AHP, sufficient for POC
3. **GPT-3.5-turbo primary:** Cost-effective, GPT-4 for complex reasoning only
4. **Streamlit for UI:** Fastest path to interactive dashboard
